The Druids, Nature, and Her Angels
=======

Nature, both its creative and destructive form, are part of every sphere in which life manages to emerge. When sentience emerges, and the first creature in the sphere looks not downwards or upwards but inwards, it divorces itself from its ancestral home. Now reaching up at new gods, at new flames, and new powers, Nature becomes as an option to engage with or not. We often fail to treat her as she deserves.

Through Her is an ancient power, not the instant but the enduring, with which roots break boulders, the old begets new, the new becomes old, and by which the old fades out. Through Nature, Life. 

Arguing with Nature resembles logic, or perhaps the opposite is true. There is a way things will be, and our ability to discuss the state of things with Nature is what saves us from cold rain and the wildfires, what to eat, and by what means to stave off predation.
This knowledge is held closest by the druids and shamans, with whom Nature convenes directly, sending Her Angels to represent her.

Nature guides

Nature finds Her likeness in the forms that life takes on each sphere. Her presence is evident, whether through plant or animal. To interact with all of Her is impossible, as every piece of her is in conflict with one another in some way. The deserts and tundras will never agree, as will the mountains and forests. However, these regions can be interacted with through Her representatives.

The druids and shamans are Her desciples, providing the sentient ones with a way to interact with Her consciously, and without ignorance. Through her Angels, the guardians and denizens, She convenes with the druids and shamans, who learn from Her the ways of the land and nature surrounding them. Through these meetings, treatises are made and negotiated. Through this, farms and hunting grounds are deliniated and agreed on. 

They are however seldom binding, instead mostly deliniating what the sentient ones can come to expect of Her.

Her patience and generosity

Her angels can share the knowledge of where to and where not to farm. How to fend off the wolves and voles, as well as provide aide to the struggling wheat. In this way, a civilization can be on good terms with Her, but it could be better. 

In societies and townships with large druidic and shamanic presence, there is often more than just a common understanding of the limits that Nature grants us. There may even be ceremonies and celebrations in which nature is engratiated and expanded, trees get planted and pruned, and habitats get made. By this process, humanity is in effect on the path of domesticating nature. This path is however endless, as it is in her essence to grow, and break even shackles she may have agreed to long ago.

So long as this society does not get overzealous in its domestication, he may become her steward. As the great beasts of the steppe dictate her landscape, and the beavers of the wetlands shape her contours, Nature can reward holistic stewardship of her by giving us a Human habitat. In one such habitat, one may find paths in the wilderness as wide as two wheelbarrows, well-pruned fruit trees, and outcrops of blueberries and thyme.

The balance is hard to attain, hard to maintain, and as slow-going or enduring as Nature herself.


Her fickle wrath
===
![If exploited, the bill will come due.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InvertedTech/KnowledgeBase/main/Test/denizen4.png)
Like torrential rivers carving out valleys, or the shattering of slate under the steadfast tree, where Her will leads, She will go. If your civilization is a stewarding, or even just a respectful one, there is no need to fear wrath. She is indifferent to those who don't get in her way.

But beware to townships who punish their druids and shamans, or do not heed their warnings. Her magic doesn't remain at the forest's edge, it reaches into your fields, your food, the thatch in your roof, the clothes you wear, and the heart that she beats for you. It may seem strange for one who can look inward, since the way you make sense of reality is through this lens. Realize, with this inward vision, that you need to look outward and face that which you have failed to respect thus far. 

Remember that you hail from Her, and you will return to Her.
